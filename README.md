All the configuration you need to make is in the `assets` folder. It includes two folders:

For each main component, there is one configuration file. For example:
- Menu ‚Üí `menuConfig.js`
- Footer ‚Üí `footerConfig.js`

You can change these based on your need.

You can put all your images here and import them like shown in the first few lines of each config file.
